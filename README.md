beerxml concat
======================

Little utility for combining Beer.XML recipe files into a single Beer.xml file containing all the recipes. I made this to help ease importing all of my Beer.xml files (exported from Beer Alchemy) into Brewtoad. Brewtoad only allows you to upload single Beer.xml files, so if you happen to have a collection of Beer.xml files, you can use this to combine them into a single uploadable file.

Uses:
  - [jQuery 2.0](http://jquery.com)
  - [jQuery-file-upload](http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/) (requires jqueryui.widget and jquery.iframe.transport)
